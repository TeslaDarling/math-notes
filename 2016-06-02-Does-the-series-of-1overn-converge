If you have a series of 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4...., is it possible to prove that given any number M, 
if you sum the series for long enough you can get a number N such that N > M? 

Silly thoughts: 
At first I thought you could attack this problem by doing '1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8...', saying that would get 
close to but never sum to 1. 

But the right way to do it is just to say 'we need to find a pattern that repeats, such that we can say
after this pattern repeats, then the sum N has increased by some number A'

If we try to do this for A=1, we actually see a pattern for 1/2 - if we sum, for example, 1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8, 
we know that we have 4x(something whose mean is >1/8), so this is >1/2. In general, if we start at 1/n, 
and we go forward n steps, the sum of 1/n to 1/2n will be >1/2 (same logic as above) - it will be 
n*(something whose mean is >1/2n). 

This becomes interesting when we consider 1/x - it turns out that this is like the integral of 1/x
(which is ln(x) - think about it, you can approximate the area under 1/x by 1*1/n for stepsizes of 1). 
So the integral of ln(x) is close to this sum! Which is cool because the area increases 
~a if 2^a=n after n steps. So given n, the area should be ~log2(n) - and it is ln(n), which is close to this.

The most fun thing to do here is to try to calculate ln(ln(x)) of things. It's amazing how slow logarithms go! 
If you take base 3, for ease of calculation, and try to figure out how large x has to be to get to ln(ln(x)) 
equaling four, it is 3^(3^4) or 3^81 or ~10^40. The age of our universe is ~4 billion years (10^9), so if you
take the number of seconds that have elapsed (10^9*10^3*10^5), that's only 10^17 - and if our universe is only 
supposed to live on the order of 10^9-10^10, we're still > 10^20 powers way from how long it would take us
if we did one operation per second. If we did 10 billion operations per second (normal compute time?), we 
get 10^10 powers away. So with a current computer running our entire lifetime, we never get to 4 
in ln(ln(x)). 

An interesting counterpart is to try this with base 2, which gets there easily within an hour - the difference
you get is amazing! So cool!
